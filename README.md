# Description
This is PDA firmware for ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display. Inspired by Palm OS.

PDA is Personal Digital Assistant. Small handheld computer. Like smartphone without phone functions.

# Details
* No additional hardware required. All you need is CYD
* But if you have a speaker it can beep on events.
* It uses internal flash for files storage. FFat as filesystem. You can do backups from FFat to SD.
* Or you can use SD as storage. SD if preferred.
* You can add your own internal apps by modifying arduino code.

# Installation via web flasher
* https://sau412.github.io/esp32_cyd_pda/flash

# Build and flash with PlatformIO
* Install PlatformIO Core (`pio`) and a USB serial driver for the ESP32 board.
* Build the firmware: `./build.sh build`
* Flash it: `PORT=/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX ./build.sh flash` (Linux commonly uses `/dev/ttyUSB0`)
* Open the serial monitor: `PORT=/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX ./build.sh monitor`
* Build and flash in one step: `PORT=/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX ./build.sh all`
* Refresh the web flasher bundle: `./build.sh web`

PlatformIO downloads the ESP32 toolchain and libraries on the first build. The
project uses the repository's `TFT_eSPI/User_Setup.h` and the custom
`partitions-ffat.csv` layout automatically.
